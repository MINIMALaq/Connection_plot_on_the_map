# Sankey_plot_on_the_map
Visualizing Sankey plot on a map with python.

Basically used one of the D3 [connection map](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/connectionmap_csv.html) to visulize the connections between points. <br>

The data source is https://mobilitylab.ut.ee/OD/.<br>

I downloaded one of the files and made it ready to use for D3 example.
